# Digital Signal Processing Toolkit

A comprehensive MATLAB toolkit for digital signal processing, featuring audio analysis, filtering, and modulation techniques. This project demonstrates practical implementations of DSP concepts including FFT analysis, FIR filter design, and amplitude modulation.

## Key Features

### Signal Processing
- FIR filter design using Kaiser window
- Low-pass and high-pass filtering
- Custom signal generation for testing
- Real-time spectrum analysis

### Modulation
- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Carrier wave generation
- Modulation and demodulation
- Spectrum visualization

### Analysis Tools
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation
- Frequency spectrum analysis
- Time-domain visualization
- Signal comparison tools
